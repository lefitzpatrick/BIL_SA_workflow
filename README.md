# BIL-SA

The overall goal of this project is to develop the next-generation prediction system for determining the mean and extreme net basin supply and water levels to provide the foundation for defining risks of coastal inundation impacts and lake management decisions across subseasonal to annual time scales for the Great Lakes.

The purpose of this repository is to help develop, track, apply and evaluate the different model tracks used to predict lake water levels for each of the Great Lakes.
